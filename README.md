# BurialThemedMusicPlayer
Music Player with all the basic features. Play,pause,skip to next, skip to previous. I might use it later for a fan project

This is a music player with 4 basic features: play,pause,skip to next, skip to previous.
Audio is also tracked and can you cna navigate through the track by clicking.
Right now I am using local audio files but I would like to hook either hook it up with spotify API or use it for my fan project where I will expand on functionality.

I enjoyed the project and I am utilizing modules a lot
